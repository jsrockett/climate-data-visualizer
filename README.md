# weather-visualizer
fall '21 OSU Hackathon project, climate data visualization web app

## Inspiration

Data visualization is important for being able to understand the scope of a problem and that we had trouble finding easily accessibly data of this type?

## What it does

Our Pollutant Data Visualizer allows a user to select a state and a county to get information on the amount of different pollutants in the air.

## How we built it

We built this webpage by using html, javascript, and css to layout our project and give it the functionality we needed. Since we needed data
on the air quality of different locations, we decided to use a government API that already has that information and we would pull this data
based on the user selection of the state, county, and the date they wished to look at.

## Challenges we ran into

We ran into a lot of challenges working on this project, the biggest issue we had was learning the near libraries/APIs to use them correctly
in what we wanted them to do. The API documentation was difficult to understand at times and had a lot of different parts to it which
added to the complexity of receiving the exact information we wanted. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of being able to learn something new when building our project, like the air quality API and a graph creation library, and being able to include it into our project.

## What we learned

We learned how to use the air quality API and chart.js.

## What's next for Pollutant Data Visualizer

We planned on having a lot more features involved in our project, but we couldn't get around to it since we had a lot of trouble learning these new libraries and getting the information we wanted. In addition to that, the things we wanted to add, like a download button to download the information to a CSV file and other graphical visualizations, took a lot of time to figure out how to accomplish it. So in the future, we would want to add these components to our project.
